# Changes and Possible Issues with State-Machine version

pokeHistory.laser -> logs side laser state (as before)
	(can we change this to 'sideLaserState' ?)
pokeHistory.centerLaserState -> logs center laser state (new)
- Testing this out

Poke timing counts on NoseIn. If nose is in too long, next trial can already start. OK for now?

Overlapping laser stimuli interact in unexpected ways.

How to distinguish between mouse-elicited rewards (true rewards)
and "bonus" rewards manually delivered by experimenter

To Do:
- **** Add "deliver extra reward button" (during experiment)
	- Done, but how does it affect trial history/statistics???
- Stop expt button: turn off all LEDs/Laser/reward
	- Done ?
- Have Max-duration timeout for variable laser stim
- Add new laser stim type: center-in -> side-out


After trial is initiated, does centerPoke count as "decision" "incorrect" poke? Transition to ITI??
-Yes

Need for Markov option? -NO
