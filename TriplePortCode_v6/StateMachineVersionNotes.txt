# Changes and Possible Issues with State-Machine version

pokeHistory.laser -> logs side laser state (as before)
	(can we change this to 'sideLaserState' ?)
pokeHistory.centerLaserState -> logs center laser state (new)

After trial is initiated, does centerPoke count as "decision" "incorrect" poke? Transition to ITI??

Need for Markov option? -NO

Poke timing counts on NoseIn. If nose is in too long, next trial can already start. OK for now?

Overlapping laser stimuli interact in unexpected ways.

Some laser parameters are hard-coded and shared with center & sides:
- delay, pulse duration, pulse period

To Do:
- **** Add "deliver extra reward button" (during experiment)
- Stop expt button: turn off all LEDs/Laser/reward
- Have Max-duration timeout for variable laser stim
- Add new laser stim type: center-in -> side-out
