# Changes and Possible Issues with State-Machine version

pokeHistory.laser -> logs side laser state (as before)
	(can we change this to 'sideLaserState' ?)
pokeHistory.centerLaserState -> logs center laser state (new)

After trial is initiated, does centerPoke count as "decision" "incorrect" poke? Transition to ITI??
