# Changes and Possible Issues with State-Machine version

pokeHistory.laser -> logs side laser state (as before)
	(can we change this to 'sideLaserState' ?)
pokeHistory.centerLaserState -> logs center laser state (new)

After trial is initiated, does centerPoke count as "decision" "incorrect" poke? Transition to ITI??

Need for Markov option?

Poke timing counts on NoseIn. If nose is in too long, next trial can already start. OK for now?
